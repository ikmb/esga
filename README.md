This pipeline peforms annotation of novel genomes using a combination of evidence alignments, evidence-based gene building and ab-initio gene building.

### Pipeline main steps

The minimum requirements are a genome file and at least one type of evidence.

### Test data

A simple test data set can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VFqLnRJiuj5Vhj2KCOdY58jwxZKkkMVU)
